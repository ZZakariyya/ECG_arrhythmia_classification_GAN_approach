# ECG_arrhythmia_classification_GAN_approach
This is updated version of my previous work on this subject. I practised Data augmentation with GAN on ECG arrhytmia classfication

As you may know, data from physionet has a big imbalance issue. So I used GAN for generating more data for classes with less information. It is probably one of the simple versions of GAN, but it still works though. It is slow, but we get the results.
